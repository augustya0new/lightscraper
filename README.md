# LightScraper

LightScraper is a lightweight and easy-to-use web scraping tool designed to extract data from web pages. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for scraping information, saving it to a file, and retrieving the scraped data.

## Installation

To install LightScraper, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract its contents.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

   ```
   cd path/to/lightscraper
   ```

4. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) to isolate the dependencies.

   ```
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

5. Activate the virtual environment.

   - For Windows:

     ```
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For macOS and Linux:

     ```
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

6. Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. The installation is now complete. You can proceed to the next section to learn how to use LightScraper.

## Usage

Using LightScraper is straightforward. Follow the steps below to scrape web pages and save the data to a file:

1. Ensure you are in the project directory and the virtual environment is activated (if used).

2. Open the `scraper.py` file in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).

3. Customize the scraper by modifying the `lightscraper.py` file. You can define the scraping logic and specify the data you want to extract from web pages.

   - Specify the target URLs you want to scrape by modifying the `urls` list in the `lightscraper.py` file.

   - Define the scraping logic by implementing the `LightScraper` class in the `lightscraper.py` file. Inside the class, you can define the desired data extraction process.

4. Run the `scraper.py` file.

   ```
   python scraper.py
   ```

   The scraper will visit the specified URLs, extract the desired data using the defined logic, and save the scraped data to the `data/scraped_data.txt` file.

5. Open the `scraped_data.txt` file located in the `data` directory to access the scraped data. The data will be structured according to your scraping logic and the format you specified.

   Note: If the `data` directory or `scraped_data.txt` file doesn't exist, the scraper will create them automatically.

## Example

Here's a basic example to get you started with LightScraper:

1. Open the `lightscraper.py` file in a text editor.

2. Modify the `urls` list to include the target URLs you want to scrape.

   ```python
   urls = [
       'https://example.com/page1',
       'https://example.com/page2',
       'https://example.com/page3',
   ]
   ```

3. Define the scraping logic by implementing the `LightScraper` class. Customize the `extract_data` method to extract the desired information from the web pages.

   ```python
   class LightScraper:
       def __init__(self):
           # Initialize any required variables or configurations

       def extract_data(self, page_content):
           # Implement the data extraction logic here
           # Extract the desired information from the page content
           # Return the extracted data

   # Create an instance of the LightScraper class
   scraper = LightScraper()
   ```

4. Save the `lightscraper.py` file.

5. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory

.

6. Activate the virtual environment (if used).

7. Run the `scraper.py` file.

   ```
   python scraper.py
   ```

   LightScraper will visit the specified URLs, extract the desired data using the defined logic, and save the scraped data to the `data/scraped_data.txt` file.

8. Open the `scraped_data.txt` file located in the `data` directory to access the scraped data.

Feel free to modify the scraping logic and customize the data extraction process to meet your specific requirements. You can refer to the documentation within the `lightscraper.py` file for further guidance on advanced features and options.
